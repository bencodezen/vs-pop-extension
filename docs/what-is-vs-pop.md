# What is VS POP?

VS POP (pronounced /viz-pop/) is a VS Code extension for helping developers practice the "progress over perfection" (i.e., POP) principle. It aims to avoid the standard pitfall of productivity tools that focused solely on outcome, which is useful but rarely captures the true effort that developers make in their day to day.

## How does it work?

How do developers spend most of their time? In Git. So VS POP leverages the commit messages that developers write as a way to integrate into the developer workflow seamlessly.
