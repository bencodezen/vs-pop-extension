![Screenshot of VS POP extension](vs-pop-screenshot.png)

This is a VS Code extension inspired by the "progress over perfection" (POP) principle. Most productivity tools are focused merely on outcomes, but those rarely reflect the true effort that developers make in their day to day.

You can check out the [official docs here](https://vs-pop-extension.netlify.app/).
